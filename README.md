# INTRODUCTION TO FP IN SCALA: EXPLORING A TOOLBOX FOR SOLVING COMMON PROBLEMS

This workshop is designed for all those interested in learning functional programming, and in tackling real world problems that they must solve every day in their work. Functional programming brings sanity to our industry, as it gives us the ability to handle complexity with modular and composable code. We must keep in mind, however that functional programming is not a magic wand that will suddenly make complexity disappear. If your problem is relatively difficult, simple immutable data structures and function composition will not suffice. Complexity is hard, but simplicity is not easy, either. The good news is, all the problems you regularly encounter were solved decades ago. If you know the solutions, you wonâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel.

## What is needed

* Scala
* SBT http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
* GIT (to fetch this repository :) )


Make sure that `sbt compile` works.
